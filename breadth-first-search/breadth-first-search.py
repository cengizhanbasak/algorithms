# breadth first search is an algorithm on graph traversals
# starting from a root, traversal is made by 
# visiting all the neighbours before going one level deeper
# implementation differs by how we represent the graphs

# example: directed, unweighted graph is represented by a 2D list (adjacency matrix)
# O(VË†2)
