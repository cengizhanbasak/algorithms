# depth first search is an algorithm on graph traversals
# starting from a root traversal is made by 
# going as deep as possible without backtracking
# implementation differs by how we represent the graphs

# example: directed, unweighted graph is represented by a 2D list (adjacency matrix)
# O(VË†2)
# note: this implementation does not traverse all the vertices
